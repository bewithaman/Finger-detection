Finger-detection
================

A Linux-based application for live motion 
gesture recognition using webcam input in python. This 
application uses the webcam to detect gesture made by the 
user and perform basic operations accordingly. The user has to 
perform a particular gesture. The webcam captures this and 
identifies the gesture, recognises it (against a set of known 
gestures) and performs the action corresponding to it. This is 
very useful for a hands-free approach.
